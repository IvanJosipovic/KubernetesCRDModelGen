If no EBS volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use instance store volumes. If EBS volumes are specified, then the Spark configuration spark.local.dir will be overridden.

With autoscaling local storage, Databricks monitors the amount of free disk space available on your cluster's Spark workers. If a worker begins to run too low on disk, Databricks automatically attaches a new EBS volume to the worker before it runs out of disk space. EBS volumes are attached up to a limit of 5 TB of total disk space per instance (including the instance's local storage). To scale down EBS usage, make sure you have autotermination_minutes and autoscale attributes set. More documentation available at cluster configuration page.

                    description: Some instance types you use to run clusters may have locally attached disks. Databricks may store shuffle data or temporary data on these locally attached disks. To ensure that all data at rest is encrypted for all storage types, including shuffle data stored temporarily on your cluster's local disks, you can enable local disk encryption. When local disk encryption is enabled, Databricks generates an encryption key locally unique to each cluster node and uses it to encrypt all data stored on local disks. The scope of the key is local to each cluster node and is destroyed along with the cluster node itself. During its lifetime, the key resides in memory for encryption and decryption and is stored encrypted on the disk. Your workloads may run more slowly because of the performance impact of reading and writing encrypted data to and from local volumes. This feature is not available for all Azure Databricks subscriptions. Contact your Microsoft or Databricks account representative to request access.

                  autoscaler.

With autoscaling local storage, Databricks monitors the amount of free disk space available on your cluster's Spark workers. If a worker begins to run too low on disk, Databricks automatically attaches a new EBS volume to the worker before it runs out of disk space. EBS volumes are attached up to a limit of 5 TB of total disk space per instance (including the instance's local storage). To scale down EBS usage, make sure you have autotermination_minutes and autoscale attributes set. More documentation available at cluster configuration page.

                    description: Some instance types you use to run clusters may have locally attached disks. Databricks may store shuffle data or temporary data on these locally attached disks. To ensure that all data at rest is encrypted for all storage types, including shuffle data stored temporarily on your cluster's local disks, you can enable local disk encryption. When local disk encryption is enabled, Databricks generates an encryption key locally unique to each cluster node and uses it to encrypt all data stored on local disks. The scope of the key is local to each cluster node and is destroyed along with the cluster node itself. During its lifetime, the key resides in memory for encryption and decryption and is stored encrypted on the disk. Your workloads may run more slowly because of the performance impact of reading and writing encrypted data to and from local volumes. This feature is not available for all Azure Databricks subscriptions. Contact your Microsoft or Databricks account representative to request access.

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out

                  through a Crossplane feature flag.

                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to

                  take on the managed and external resources.

                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default

                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are

                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.

EBS volumes are attached up to a limit of 5 TB of total disk space per instance (including the instance's local storage). To scale down EBS usage, make sure you have autotermination_minutes and autoscale attributes set. More documentation available at cluster configuration page.

To ensure that all data at rest is encrypted for all storage types, including shuffle data stored temporarily on your cluster's local disks, you can enable local disk encryption. When local disk encryption is enabled, Databricks generates an encryption key locally unique to each cluster node and uses it to encrypt all data stored on local disks. The scope of the key is local to each cluster node and is destroyed along with the cluster node itself. During its lifetime, the key resides in memory for encryption and decryption and is stored encrypted on the disk. Your workloads may run more slowly because of the performance impact of reading and writing encrypted data to and from local volumes. This feature is not available for all Azure Databricks subscriptions. Contact your Microsoft or Databricks account representative to request access.
