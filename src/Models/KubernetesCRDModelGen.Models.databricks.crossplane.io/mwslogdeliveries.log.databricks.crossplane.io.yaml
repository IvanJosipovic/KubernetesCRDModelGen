                  WriteConnectionSecretToReference specifies the namespace and name of a

                  Secret to which any connection details for this managed resource should

                  be written. Connection details frequently include the endpoint, username,

                  and password required to connect to the managed resource.

                  This field is planned to be replaced in a future release in favor of

                  PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both could be set independently

                  and connection details would be published to both without affecting

                  each other.
