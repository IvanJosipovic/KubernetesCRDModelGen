                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to

                  take on the managed and external resources.

                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default

                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
