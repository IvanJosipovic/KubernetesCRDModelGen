                  DeletionPolicy specifies what will happen to the underlying external

                  when this managed resource is deleted - either "Delete" or "Orphan" the

                  external resource.

                  This field is planned to be deprecated in favor of the ManagementPolicies

                  field in a future release. Currently, both could be set independently and

                  non-default values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled.
